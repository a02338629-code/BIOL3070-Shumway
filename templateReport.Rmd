When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## BACKGROUND

Fill in some text here that provides background info on the WNV system, the blood meal DNA extractions, PCR, sequencing, etc.

```{r viremia}
```

## MAJOR QUESTION

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

# Fill in name of first analysis/plot

#put code here
```
# Fill in name of second analysis/plot

```

## FORMAL ANALYSIS

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
